# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications when accessing undefined variables within component functions.  The error, "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')", arises when a component tries to access a property of a variable that has not been defined or is null.

## Reproducing the Error

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Navigate to `/about`.

You will see an error in your browser's console similar to:

`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution to handle this type of error using optional chaining or nullish coalescing.  See the solution for implementation details.

## How to avoid this issue:

* **Initialize variables:** Always initialize variables before attempting to access their properties. Assign a default value (like null or an empty object) if the variable might not always have a value.
* **Optional chaining (?.)** Use the optional chaining operator (?.) to safely access properties of potentially undefined or null objects.  This will prevent the error by short-circuiting the evaluation if the left-hand side is undefined or null.
* **Nullish coalescing (??):** Use the nullish coalescing operator (??) to provide a default value if a variable is null or undefined.
* **Conditional rendering:** Use conditional rendering to only render parts of your component if the necessary data is available.
